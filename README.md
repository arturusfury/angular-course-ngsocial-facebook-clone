# ngSocial - Facebook app - Angular Demo

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  Here I used
the angular-seed repo hosted here on github to create our framework then I
built the page up using some basic bootstrap html and angular route knowledge.

This repo ran through using the ngFacebook angular module to make API calls to
the Graph API for Facebook.  I was able to grab basic user information, user's
wall posts and even post back to said user's wall.  Very simple functionality
but it showed the use of the Graph API.
